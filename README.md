**##Goals For This Project**

The main goal of this project was to bring together the passion that I have for books, in creating an app with the technologies learned during the past few months at [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/):
 - Creating a React app
 - Dealing with errors encountered during the development of the app
 - Using GitHub in a productive way
 - Implementing payment methods with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs)
 - Showcasing my set of skills
 - Practicing the new knowledge

**##Interface**

For the interface I opted for a simple, easy to use Interface to allow every customer to experience this app in the simplest and fastest way possible. The CSS applied is intented to make it easy to the eye to be seen, and everything is presented in a very minimalist way.


**##Audience**

The audience targeted with this app is very broad. Everyone, at every age should be able to use this app, as is very easy to just go and see pictures of the books, a small summary added for each and one of them, and a very straightforward method of paying. 
Is just there for everyone to use, and of course your voucher is waiting at the end!

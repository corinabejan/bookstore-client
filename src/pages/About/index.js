        <h1>A book, a coffee...</h1>
        <p>This webshop is dedicated to <span>the lovers of books and coffee</span>. I know for sure I am one of them. Definetly the biggest passion of my life are <span>BOOKS</span>, and probably <span>COFFEE</span> is the liquor that helped me survive till now.
           Most of the books that you will find here, are books that are very dear to my heart, books that changed my perspective on life, some of them totally changed my life, <span>so I hope that maybe you will enjoy them also.</span> I had a lot of moments when i just 
           found myself living like some of the heroes of these books, my ideas just becoming one with their ideas, and every time when this happened i found myself sipping some very good coffee. It is always an absolute joy to experience this, so I want to share my small 
           adventures in reading with everyone. Enjoy this as much as you can!
